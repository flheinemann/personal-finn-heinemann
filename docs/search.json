During my years with the youth team, we won the west german championship four times in the u13, u14, u18, and u20. With the age of 14, I also joined a men’s team in my hometown, where I played for 3 years, before transfering to a new club called “DJK Delbrück”, where I played in the 3. Bundesliga with the age of 17. Unfortunately, my last season in Germany got cancelled half way through and I came to Georgetown in August 2021. I am looking forward to play my third season here and qualify for the national championship tournament for the third consecutive time."
